This application can be used by any other store to automate the process of manually maintaining the records related to the subject of maintaining the stock and liquid flows. 
Features: 
Admin Can Manage All users, Manager, Cashier, Pharmacist.
This system will help the admin to manage everything and maintain the database too. He can view and check every transaction. The user can view his past bookings and order new medicines. Cashier, obviously, maintains the bills and the pharmacist maintains the stock.
Manager is assigned just to maintain the workflow.

As an admin, you can employ new managers, cashiers or pharmacists. You can update their details or delete the records.

Pharmacists give a prescription to the user, which in turn gives it to the cashier to generate the receipt. While making the prescription, before clicking the submit button, data is displayed, to ensure that the pharmacist has entered correct information. Once submitted, a pdf is generated which needs to be given to the cashier so that the receipt can be generated.
